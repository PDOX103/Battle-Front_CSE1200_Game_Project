# Battle-Front_CSE1200_Game_Project

This is "Battle-Front [Marvel vs DC]" a 2D game project which is made by using iGraphics and C/C++ language.

'Software Development-I, CSE1200' is an incredible journey filled with valuable learning experiences.  
This course not only equipped me with basic programming knowledge but also opened the door to the world of creative problem-solving and innovation.

The Story of this game: 
The story begins with two powerful gods. One of which represents the Marvel Universe and the other represents the DC Universe. 
They both consider themselves the most powerful. But both Gods are equal in power. 
Neither can defeat the other. So they decided to fight between the super heroes of their own universe. 
They merge the two universes and as a condition whoever loses the battle will have their universe completely destroyed.
